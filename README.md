## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) - For styles
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - For API requests

### Continued development

The next step to this project would be to create a server application to persist data with endpoints for the frontend to network with. With that in place
it would make sense to centralize state management on the frontend in a redux store.

### Useful resources
